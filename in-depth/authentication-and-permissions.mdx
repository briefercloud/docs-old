Ergomake's permissions system is tied to a GitHub organization. As long as a user has access to an organization, they'll have access to that organization's environments list.

<Note>
Ergomake can only access organizations to which you grant it access.

That authorization grant is done during the GitHub login, through the button indicated in the image below.

</Note>

If you can't see your organization in the accounts selector, click the "Add account" button and grant Ergomake access to it.

<Warning>We do not support GitLab or BitBucket.</Warning>

## Known Limitations

There is no fine grained control for members within an organisation or within a repo. Anyone able to open a pull-request in a repository for which Ergomake is configured will be able to spin-up a preview.
