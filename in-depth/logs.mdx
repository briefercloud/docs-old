To see build and live logs from your previews, you'll have to log into [the dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev).

There, you will see a list of repositories and their respective environments. For each environment, you'll be able to see its latest build and live logs, as shown below.

<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/logs-light.png"
    alt="Logs light"
/>

<img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/logs-dark.png"
    alt="Logs dark"
/>

Sometimes we may succeed in building your images but there may be a problem with your runtime set up. In that case, please see your environment's live logs to fix your configurations.

<Note>
Database seeds are a common cause of failure. If your seeds are trying to create a database that already exists every time, that could cause problems.

Sometimes users may miss necessary environment variables for the applications to run too, causing them not to be able to start, even though the build was successful.
