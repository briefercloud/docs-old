Ergomake Previews have the same lifetime as your pull-request, unless configured as _permanent branches_.

Ergomake preview environments are typically created when you open a pull-request, regardless of whether it's a draft.

For every pull-request, Ergomake will use the `docker-compose.yml` file in your repository's `.ergomake` folder to create an environment and send you a link.

Whenever you push a commit to that pull-request's branch, Ergomake will destroy the old environment and create a brand new one.

<Warning>
Every time an environment is re-created, you'll lose the data stored in the previous environment.

Currently, there's no way to persist data between multiple environments.

You'll have to write seed scripts with the data you need to get into a repository.

</Warning>

Once a pull-request gets merged, Ergomake will destroy the environment associated with the PR's branch, including its data, unless the PR's branch is configured as a permanent _branch_.

<Note>
Environments get destroyed when a pull-request gets merged, _not_ when the branch associated to it gets deleted.

If you merge a PR but do not delete the branch associated with it, the environment will still be destroyed.

</Note>

## Permanent branches

Permanent branches are branches whose corresponding environments should _always_ exist, regardless of whether there's an open pull request for them.

You can configure _permanent branches_ by logging into [the dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev).

There, you'll be able to select a repository and configure

    src="/images/permanent-branches-light.png"
    alt="Permanent branches light"
/>

<img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/permanent-branches-dark.png"
    alt="Permanent branches dark"
/>

## Sleeping environments

Whenever environments are inactive for the past hour, they'll be put to sleep.

If you're at the limit of simultaneous active environments, accessing a new environment will cause the least recently active environment to be put to sleep.
