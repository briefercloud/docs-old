## Writing Dockerfiles for your `docker-compose.yml`

When writing the `docker-compose.yml` file, you'll notice that you must write a `Dockerfile` for your appplication so that you can reference it in your compose file.

Just as you'd do when containerizing your app for any other circumstances, this `Dockerfile` should package your application within a [container image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container-image) so that the application starts when you `docker run` a container using that image.

<Tip>
    If you're not familiar with Docker, we highly recommend reading [Docker's
    official "Get Started" page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started).
</Tip>

A typical Node.js Express app, for example, would have a `Dockerfile` similar to the one below.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install your app's dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code itself
COPY . .

# This is the port to which you'll bind Express
EXPOSE 3001

# Start the server
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Once you've created a Dockerfile for your app, reference it in your `docker-compose.yml`, as shown below.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
    api:
        build: ../path_to_your_dockerfile_folder
        ports:
            - "3001:3001"
```

Once you do that, Ergomake Bot will add a comment containing a link to your application.

By now, you should have a preview environment up and running for your application.

That's good, but most applications depend on multiple other pieces of software, like databases. To learn how to set them up, see _[Databases and other third-party applications](/configurations/third-party-software)_.

## When to write a Dockerfile

Usually, you'll only have to write a `Dockerfile` for applications you _own_ and for which there isn't a built image yet.

Take it as a rule-of-thumb that you should _not_ write `Dockerfile` for applications such as databases, or message queues. For those applications, you should usually default to picking an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), which is Docker's official image repository.

We recommend that users only write Dockerfiles when they can't find the software they need packed into a Docker Hub image.

<Tip>
    If your integrations already build a Docker image as part of your
    pull-request process, we recommend that you reuse that image so that preview
    environments come up more quickly.

## Setting build arguments

There will be cases in which a Dockerfile needs to have access to a particular service's address during build-time. One such example is when you must bundle a front-end app including the value for the back-end address to which the web app will send requests, as shown in the example Dockerfile below.

```
FROM node:16-alpine

ARG REACT_APP_API_URL

ENV REACT_APP_API_URL $REACT_APP_API_URL

# A bunch of other commands [...]

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "start-docker"]
```

In this example, we use the `REACT_APP_API_URL` build argument to set the environment variable `REACT_APP_API_URL`. This variable will be used during `npm run build` because it will go into the bundle so that the app knows what's the backend to which it should send requests.

**To provide a build argument containing service's public address, you'll use the `dev.ergomake.preview.replace-arg.YOUR_ENV_VAR` label.** Within that var, you can interpolate the address we'll generate for a service, as shown in the example below.

```yml
version: '3.8'
services:
   web:
     build:
       context: ./frontend
     ports:
       - "8080:8080"
     labels:
       # This label will cause Ergomake to set, during build time,
       # REACT_APP_API_URL to the address of the API service (https),
       # followed by "/prefix"
       dev.ergomake.env.replace-arg.REACT_APP_API_URL: 'https://{{ services.api.url }}/api'

  api:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - '3001:3001'
```
