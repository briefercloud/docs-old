We currently recommend that you incorporate seed scripts into your images. Another way to seed your environments is to create a separate service on your compose file.

## Building images with seeds

In most cases, using a built image with a seed script is the easiest way to seed a preview environment.

### Mongo example

If you're using MongoDB, you can create a `Dockerfile` using the `mongo` image as the base image, and copy the necessary seed files to the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` path within that image. Any files within that path will be automatically executed by the image when the `mongo` service starts.

Assume you have the seed script below, named `seed.js` within a `scripts` folder, for example.

```js
db.test.drop();
db.test.insertMany([
    {
        _id: 1,
        name: "Alice",
        age: 50,
    },
    {
        _id: 2,
        name: "Bob",
        age: 75,
    },
]);
```

In that case, you'll simply configure your `Dockerfile` so that the JavaScript file is copied to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` when building the image.

```
FROM mongo:3.6

COPY ./scripts/seed.js /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

Finally, you'll reference this `Dockerfile` in the `docker-compose.yml` file used by Ergomake.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
    db:
        build:
            context: ../mongo
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        restart: always
        environment:
            MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: { { USERNAME } }
            MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: { { PWD } }
            MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: { { DBNAME } }
```

<Note>
In this example, we assume the following file-tree structure:

```
.
├──── .ergomake
│   └── docker-compose.yml <--- Used by Ergomake
└──── mongo
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── scripts
        └── seed.js
```

</Note>

### Postgres Example

If you're using the [`postgres`](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) image, you can simply copy your seed scripts to `/docker-entrypoint-initb.d`. That's because the image is configured to execute any files within that directory when the `postgres` service starts.

Assume you had the seed script below, named `dump.sql`, within a `scripts` folder.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "email" TEXT NOT NULL,

  PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES ('a123', 'My Name', 'name@example.com');
```

In that case, you'd first create a script to run it, let's say `seed.sh`, within that same `scripts` folder.

```
#!/bin/bash

psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -a -f /app/scripts/db/dump.sql
```

Then, you'd configure your `Dockerfile` to copy `seed.sh` the `dump.sql` to `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, as shown below.

```
FROM postgres:12
COPY ./scripts/init.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
COPY ./scripts/dump.sql ./scripts/db/dump.sql
```

Finally, you'll reference that `Dockerfile` in the `docker-compose.yml` you use for Ergomake.

```yaml
services:
    db:
        build:
            context: ../postgres
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        environment:
            - POSTGRES_USER=user
            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
            - POSTGRES_DB=database
        ports:
            - 5432:5432
```

<Note>
In this example, we assume the following file-tree structure:

```
.
├──── .ergomake
│   └── docker-compose.yml <--- Used by Ergomake
└──── postgres
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── scripts
        ├── dump.sql
        └── seed.sh
```

</Note>

## Seeding environments with services

To seed an environment with a separate service, all you need to do is create a separate service in your compose and change its command so that it runs the seed command.

```
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: ../backend
    ports:
      - '3001:3001'

  seed:
    build: ../backend
    # Instead of running your image's command, you can use this one to override it
    command: ./my-seed-script.sh
    ports:
      - '3001:3001'
```

Another way to seed it and still have a single service is to use multiple commands on your compose.

```
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: ../backend
    # Here you'll run both your seed and your app
    command: bash -c "python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    ports:
      - '3001:3001'
```

<Warning>
Make sure that restarting your service will not cause the seed command to fail. That could happen if you're trying to create a database that already exists every time your seed script runs.

Make sure that your `command` can run multiple times without errors so that your preview environments stay up.

</Warning>
