In this page, you'll learn how applications within Ergomake find each other, how Ergomake decides whether to expose services, and, if so, which port to use.

You'll also learn how to use environment URLs during build-time for previews. That may be useful when bundling front-end apps and packaging them into containers.

## Exposing services or making them private

**Ergomake will expose to the internet the first container port bound to a `localhost` port on your `docker-compose.yml`**.

For example, if you bind a container's `3000` port to a port on `localhost`, Ergomake will expose port `3000` to the internet when deploying your that service in your preview environment.

Take the `api` and `database` services below, for example.

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
    api:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
            - 8080:3001
            - 8081:9001

    database:
        image: mongo
        ports:
            - 13337:27017
```

As shown above, the API service binds the container's `3001` port to `localhost:8080`. Consequently, Ergomake will expose the container's `3001` port over the internet.

Similarly, Ergomake will also expose the `database`'s `27017` port over the internet when creating your environment.

Here's what the URLs to reach `api` and `database` would look like in the above scenario, respectively:

-   `api`: `https://api-yourOrg-yourRepo-prNumber.env.ergomake.link`
-   `database`: `https://database-yourOrg-yourRepo-prNumber.env.ergomake.link`

Although the port `9001` for the `api` service is exposed within `localhost`, it won't be exposed to the internet. That's because only the first bound port will be exposed to the internet.

<Note>Please notice these addresses are only available over HTTP(S).</Note>

## Inter-service routing

Containers within your preview environment will talk to each other using the same hostnames they would use on your machine when you run them with Docker Compose.

That means a service named `api` can address a service named `database` by using `database` as the hostname.

Assume, for example, that you have a service named `api` containing a Node.js application. The `api` service connects to a MongoDB instance within a service named `mongo`.

```yml
# Here's an example docker-compose.yml file
version: "3.8"
services:
    api:
        build: ./backend
        ports:
            - "3001:3001"

    database:
        image: mongo
        ports:
            - "27017"
```

In that case, you can connect to MongoDB using `mongo` as the hostname within your Node.js application.

```js
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

// This is MongoDB's default port
const DB_PORT = 27017;

// To address the MongoDB instance within the `mongo` service, we use its name
const url = `mongodb://mongo:${DB_PORT}`;
const client = new MongoClient(url);

async function main() {
    await client.connect();
}
```

<Note>
    It may be that you're exposing ports so that you can use `localhost` to
    connect to them. Exposing services so that you can connect to them via
    `localhost` will _not_ work because `localhost` does not exist for Ergomake.
    Please make sure to always use your service's names when connecting to them.
</Note>

## Routing and front-end apps

When bundling a front-end app, many people use an environment variable to indicate the address of the API to which the front-end app will send requests.

To configure that URL, many front-end apps must include the back-end's URL during build-time.

As an example, assume you have a React app and that app uses the `REACT_APP_API_URL` during build time, as shown below.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

ARG REACT_APP_API_URL

ENV REACT_APP_API_URL $REACT_APP_API_URL

# A bunch of other commands [...]

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "run", "start-docker"]
```

When building the app's bundle within a Docker image, you'll have to tell Ergomake to set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` build argument with the address we'll generate for `api`. That build argument will be used to set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable that `npm run build` uses when bundling the React app.

To do that, you'll use the `dev.ergomake.env.replace-arg.YOUR_ENV_VAR` label. Within that label, you can interpolate the address we'll generate for the `api` service, as shown in the example below.

```yml
version: '3.8'
services:
   web:
     build:
       context: ./frontend
     ports:
       - "8080:8080"
     labels:
       dev.ergomake.env.replace-arg.REACT_APP_API_URL: 'https://{{ services.api.url }}'

  api:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - '3001:3001'
```

After doing that, Ergomake will use the label's value as the build argument `REACT_APP_API_URL` when creating your image.
