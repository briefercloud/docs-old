Every time a developer opens a pull request, Ergomake deploys a preview environment and adds a link to your pull request.

Your team can use those links to test your application and show your work to others.

/>

After you merge your pull-request, the environment gets destroyed.

## Getting started

1. [Log into the Ergomake dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev).
2. Select the desired organization and click the "Add Repository" button.
3. During the installation process, you'll be prompted to give it access to the repository for which you want to generate previews.
   **Make sure to select all the repositories you need**.

    > ⚠️ Ergomake can't generate previews if it doesn't have access to a repository.

4. Click the `Configure` button in the [dashboard](https://app.ergomake.dev). When you do that, Ergomake will create a PR for you with an example configuration file.
   Update this compose file with your application's configurations so that we can spin up previews for _your_ application.
5. Merge Ergomake's PR once you're happy with how the preview looks.
